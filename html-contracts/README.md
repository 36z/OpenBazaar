# HTML contract tools

The goal of the **HTML contract tools** is to create a multi platform, offline interface to build, read and manage OpenBazaar contracts.  At this stage during testing, we are relying on some CDN's for Bootstrap files for simplicity, though this will change in the future

Kudos to the guys at openPGPJS for the javascript to manage the PGP keys, etc.

## Usage
Download the entire contents of this directory, and run the index.html file.  This should open in your preferred browser, though it is recommended you run this in chrome or firefox due to compatibility issues with the OpenPGPJS javascript.
